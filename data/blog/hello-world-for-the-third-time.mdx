summary: 'Transiting from Hugo to NextJS and more'
---

Since I first started this blog, I have been using Hugo as my static site generator. However, I have decided to switch to NextJS for two main reasons:
- Customisability
    - With NextJS, I can easily create custom components and layouts to suit my needs. This allows me to have more control over the design and functionality of my blog.
- Curiosity
    - While Hugo is a great static site generator, I wanted to explore other options and see what NextJS has to offer. I have heard a lot of good things about it and wanted to give it a try.

Fundamentally, the blog is still the same. I will continue to write about my personal projects, data science, and other topics that interest me. I hope you enjoy the new look and feel of the blog!

I'm also a firm believer in not reinventing the wheel, and that it's always better to stand on the shoulders of giants! Shout out to Timothy for providing an awesome NextJS template that I have used as a base for this blog. You can find it [here](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog).
